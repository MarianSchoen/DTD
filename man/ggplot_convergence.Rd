\title{Plot loss curve}
\usage{
ggplot_convergence(fista.output, test.set = NA, EVAL.FUN, main = "")
}
\arguments{
\item{fista.output}{list, with "Convergence" entry as return by the descent_generalized_fista function}

\item{test.set}{list with "mixtures" matrix, and "quantity" matrix as returned by mix.samples or mix.samples.jitter function}

\item{EVAL.FUN}{function, that takes a single input (the tweak vector of the fista.output)}

\item{main}{string, additionally title}

\item{X.matrix}{numeric matrix, reference matrix of the DTD problem}
}
\value{
ggplot object
}
\description{
The "ggplot_convergence" function uses ggplot2 and reshape to visualize the decrease of the loss-function after
a model has been trained.
}
\details{
As input parameter it needs the output of \code{\link{descent_generalized_fista}}. If fista has been evoked
with save_all_tweaks = T, and a test set is available, the loss-function can be evaluated for all tweak vectors,
and both training and test loss curves will be plotted (=> detect overfitting).\cr
For an example see
\code{\link{descent_generalized_fista}}
