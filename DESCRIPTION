Description: Digital Tissue Deconvolution (DTD) reconstructs the cellular composition of a tissue from its bulk expression profile. In order to increase deconvolution accuracy, DTD adapts the deconvolution model to the tissue scenario via loss-function learning. Training is performed on 'in-silicio' training mixtures, for which the cellular composition are known. As input, DTD requires a labelled expression matrix. It includes functions to generate training and test mixtures, train the model, and assess its deconvolution capability via visualizations.
