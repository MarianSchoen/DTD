# What is DTD?  
The name of the "DTD" package is an acronym for Digital Tissue Deconvolution. Here, we provide functions and routines with which a bulk can be deconvoluted. 

# How to use? 
## Data generation
## Data processing
## Mixing training and test set
### Many samples --> directly
### Less samples ---> with jitter
## Train g vector
## Plot results



## Styles

The `html_vignette` template includes a basic CSS theme. To override this theme you can specify your own CSS in the document metadata as follows:

    output: 
      rmarkdown::html_vignette:
        css: mystyles.css

## Figures

You can enable figure captions by `fig_caption: yes` in YAML:

    output:
      rmarkdown::html_vignette:
        fig_caption: yes

Then you can use the chunk option `fig.cap = "Your figure caption."` in **knitr**.





Also a quote using `>`:
